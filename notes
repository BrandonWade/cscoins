reverse and sorted list challenges are identical on server side other than reverse=True as sort param
	straight forward implementation
	can possibly optimize sorting strategy based on being 64 bit unsigned int

shortest path is implementation of dijsktra
	is recursive, can maybe find an iterative approach?

prng is seeded with last soln from server
	last soln is always given when retrieving challenge from server
	used to seed the data for the challenge
		lol lookup table of precomputed seeded hashs
			probably different init seed tho
